# Start:

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# Install any missing libraries (if not already installed)
# install.packages("titanic")
# install.packages("caret")
# install.packages("dplyr")

# Load the libraries
library(titanic)    # Titanic dataset
library(caret)      # Confusion matrix and performance metrics (optional)
library(dplyr)      # Data manipulation (optional)
```

# Step 1: Create training and testing sets with 75% data for training

```{r}
# Load titanic data
library(titanic)
df = titanic_train

# Set a seed for reproducibility
set.seed(1)

# Split data into training and testing sets
train.index = sample(1:nrow(df), 0.75 * nrow(df))
df.train = df[train.index, ]    # Training set
df.test  = df[-train.index, ]   # Testing set
```

# Step 2: Determine the odds of survival for men vs women using a table

```{r}
# Create a table showing the survival counts based on gender
table(df.train$Sex, df.train$Survived)

# Calculate odds ratio for men vs women
odds_men <- sum(df.train$Survived[df.train$Sex == 'male'] == 1) / sum(df.train$Survived[df.train$Sex == 'male'] == 0)
odds_women <- sum(df.train$Survived[df.train$Sex == 'female'] == 1) / sum(df.train$Survived[df.train$Sex == 'female'] == 0)
odds_ratio <- odds_men / odds_women

odds_ratio
```

# Step 3: Fit a logistic regression model with sex as a predictor

```{r}
# Fit logistic regression model
modelsex = glm(Survived ~ Sex, data = df.train, family = binomial)
summary(modelsex)
```

# Step 4: Fit main effects and interaction models

```{r}
# Main effects model
mainmodel = glm(Survived ~ Sex + as.factor(Pclass) + Age, data = df.train, family = binomial)
summary(mainmodel)

# Two-way interactions model
twowaymodel = glm(Survived ~ (Sex + as.factor(Pclass) + Age)^2, data = df.train, family = binomial)
summary(twowaymodel)
```

# Step 5: Compare the two models using drop in deviance and ANOVA

```{r}
# Use ANOVA to compare models
anova(mainmodel, twowaymodel, test = "Chisq")
```

# Step 6: Interpret the odds ratio for age on survival 

```{r}
# Extracting and interpreting the odds ratio for age
exp(coef(mainmodel)["Age"])
```

# End.
